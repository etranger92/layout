I did not pay that much attention to the css design as my goal was to make a responsive layout using one specific method for each such: float, flex, grid and other.
*Note: It is not a good practice to mainly focus on one method to make a layout. Mixing methods into one layout is way better, as every methods has got his own advantage over an other depending of the content and the display that you want.
